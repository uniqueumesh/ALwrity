# Content Strategy Production-Readiness Audit and Plan

This document is the design output of `cs/phase-1` (audit + plan only,
no code changes). It cross-references issues #589 (the production
audit) and #590 (the test matrix) and proposes a phased execution
path that prioritises the still-valid critical issues without
duplicating work that has already landed on main.

Issues #206 (long-term analytics roadmap) and #209 (autofill
phased-inputs design) are explicitly out of scope for this phase
and for the production fix window. They are large feature efforts
that should be planned in their own right.

---

## 1. State of the 4 critical issues from #589 today

A line-by-line audit against current `main` shows that three of the
four critical bugs from #589 are already fixed. Only one is still
live.

### #1: Strict source white-list collision -- ALREADY FIXED

`backend/api/content_planning/services/content_strategy/autofill/schema.py:32-45`

The current source whitelist contains all 12 tags that #589 claims
are missing:

```python
if spec['source'] not in {
    'website_analysis',
    'research_preferences',
    'api_keys_data',
    'onboarding_session',
    'persona_data',
    'competitor_analysis',
    'analytics_data',
    'deep_competitor_analysis',   # claimed missing -- present
    'gsc_analytics',                # claimed missing -- present
    'bing_analytics',               # claimed missing -- present
    'ai_generated',                 # claimed missing -- present
    'unified',                      # claimed missing -- present
}:
```

The audit's "5 missing tags" claim is stale; all 12 are present. The
whitelist does not need to change.

The audit is still useful as a regression net: a test should pin the
whitelist so the next refactor does not accidentally drop a tag. T1
in #590 is the right test for this.

### #2: AI refresh refactor -- FILE NO LONGER EXISTS

`backend/api/content_planning/services/content_strategy/autofill/autofill_service.py:6`

```
Replaces: autofill_service.py, unified_autofill_service.py, ai_refresh.py
```

`ai_refresh.py` was retired in favour of `autofill_service.py`. The
"100% synthetic text generation" claim from #589 is therefore
stale. A new audit of `autofill_service.py` is the next step
before deciding whether the AI refresh path still needs the
preservation guard, but this is out of scope for `cs/phase-1` per
the user direction (skip the AI refresh refactor).

### #3: Hardcoded multi-tenant collision -- ALREADY FIXED

`frontend/src/stores/strategyBuilderStore.ts:924`

```
// Removed: smartAutofill (replaced by autofillStrategyFields above)
```

The hardcoded `smartAutofill(1)` call was removed and replaced by
`autofillStrategyFields` (line 198, 677), which pulls the strategy
context from the live store state. The multi-tenant collision is
gone.

A test should pin this -- T16 in #590 ("smart autofill uses current
strategy id") is the right test, but the function name has changed.
The test is renamed to `test_autofillStrategyFields_uses_current_strategy_id`
in our test plan.

### #4: Hook stale closure hazard -- STILL LIVE (the only real critical issue)

`frontend/src/components/ContentPlanningDashboard/components/ContentStrategyBuilder/hooks/useAutoPopulation.ts:16-37`

The current useEffect dependency array is:

```typescript
}, [autoPopulateAttempted, isAutoPopulating, autoPopulateFromOnboarding]);
```

`completionStats` is read inside the effect (lines 20-22) but is not
in the dep array. `autoPopulateFromOnboarding` is in the array, but
the function reference can change between renders if the parent
recreates it, and the effect would then capture a stale closure on
the first render. The audit's "stale closure hazard" is real,
though the wording about which references are missing is
incomplete.

The fix in `cs/phase-1.1` is a one-line change: add `completionStats`
to the dependency array. The more correct fix is to wrap
`autoPopulateFromOnboarding` in `useCallback` at the parent so the
reference is stable, but that is a larger refactor across multiple
files and is not required to close the immediate hazard.

---

## 2. Coverage gap from #590 (the test matrix)

The audit found 22 test cases (T1-T22) but the repo has zero
`test_autofill*` files. This is the most actionable finding from the
audit: even though the bugs themselves are largely fixed, the fixes
have no regression net. The next refactor in the autofill pipeline
can silently re-introduce the same bugs.

The 22 tests map cleanly to one test file:

```
backend/tests/content_strategy/test_autofill_pipeline.py
```

The file is split into four sections per the audit's table:
- Backend pipeline tests (T1-T10)
- Frontend pipeline tests (T11-T17) -- frontend tests run in the JS
  test suite, not pytest, so these become a separate
  `frontend/src/.../autofill.test.ts`. The source-level equivalent in
  the Python test file is a guard test that asserts the relevant
  source symbols exist.
- Integration and E2E tests (T18-T22) -- same approach: source-level
  guards plus a smoke-test runtime check where the
  autofill_service can be exercised without a live DB.

P0 (T1-T18) is the urgent set. P1 (T19-T22) and P2 (T9, T10, T17)
are scheduled for follow-up phases.

## 3. Plan

| Phase | Focus | Files | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cs/phase-1` | **This document. Audit + plan only.** | 0 source files | 0.5 day |
| `cs/phase-1.1` | Fix the still-live useAutoPopulation dep array | 1 file | 0.25 day |
| `cs/phase-1.2` | Add the 14 P0 tests from #590 as a regression net | 1 backend test file | 1-1.5 days |
| `cs/phase-1.3` | Add the 4 P1 backend tests and 1 frontend test | 1 backend + 1 frontend | 0.5 day |
| `cs/phase-1.4` | Audit the new `autofill_service.py` to see if the AI refresh concern from #589 is still relevant | 1 file | 0.5 day |
| `cs/phase-1.5` | Defer until #590 is closed: P2 tests, the 4 e2e tests, the per-field lock, the per-field regenerate | tbd | tbd |

Total `cs/phase-1` family: ~3.25 days against the original ~14-day
estimate (because 3 of 4 critical bugs are already fixed and #2 is
deferred).

---

## 4. The useAutoPopulation fix in detail

The current implementation in
`frontend/src/components/ContentPlanningDashboard/components/ContentStrategyBuilder/hooks/useAutoPopulation.ts`:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!autoPopulateAttempted && !isAutoPopulating) {
    // ... reads completionStats but does not list it in deps ...
    setIsAutoPopulating(true);
    autoPopulateFromOnboarding();   // referenced in deps
    setAutoPopulateAttempted(true);
    setIsAutoPopulating(false);
  }
}, [autoPopulateAttempted, isAutoPopulating, autoPopulateFromOnboarding]);
```

The minimum change for `cs/phase-1.1`:

```typescript
}, [autoPopulateAttempted, isAutoPopulating, autoPopulateFromOnboarding, completionStats]);
```

The minimum is not the right fix long-term -- the right fix is to wrap
`autoPopulateFromOnboarding` in `useCallback` at the call site so its
reference is stable. But that refactor is out of scope for the
production fix; the dep-array addition is the smallest change that
closes the immediate hazard, and it does not change behaviour for
any current consumer.

The test that pins this fix is part of `cs/phase-1.2` (T11 in #590,
renamed to `test_useAutoPopulation_lists_completionStats_in_deps`).

---

## 5. Test plan for `cs/phase-1.2`

The 14 P0 tests from #590 land in one file. For each, the audit
column shows the strategic target, and the test implementation is
chosen to be cheap (source-level) where the runtime check would
require a live DB or external service.

| # | Source-level | Runtime |
|---|---|---|
| T1 `test_autofill_schema_validation_accepts_ai_source` | x | x |
| T2 `test_autofill_partial_data_returns_non_empty_fields` | x | -- |
| T3 `test_unified_autofill_merge_conflict_resolution` | x | -- |
| T4 `test_unified_autofill_schema_compliance` | x | x |
| T11 `test_useAutoPopulation_lists_completionStats_in_deps` | x | -- |
| T12 `test_auto_population_skips_generic_placeholders` | x | -- |
| T13 `test_form_data_merge_does_not_overwrite_user_edits` | x | -- |
| T14 `test_auto_population_rate_limit_blocks_retry` | x | -- |
| T18 `test_e2e_onboarding_to_strategy_autofill` | x | -- |

Six of the 14 P0 tests are pure source-level; the rest need either
the schema file or the autofill service. None of them need a live
database. The "source-level + runtime" combo for T1 and T4 is the
only one that exercises the actual validator.

Tests T15-T17 (also P0 by #590's table) are frontend tests; they
land in `cs/phase-1.3` as a separate `autofill.test.ts` file under
`frontend/src/.../`.

---

## 6. Risk register and rollback

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Adding `completionStats` to the deps causes an effect re-run loop | The effect guard `if (!autoPopulateAttempted && !isAutoPopulating)` short-circuits the second call. We add a runtime smoke test that mounts the hook with a fixed `completionStats` and asserts the API is called exactly once. |
| T1-T22 tests have implicit runtime dependencies on the tenant DB or the AI provider | We restrict P0 to source-level checks; only T1 and T4 are runtime, and both use the schema validator with a synthetic payload (no DB, no AI). |
| Stale test scripts in `cs/phase-1` if the user changes priority | Each sub-phase is one PR. The user can review and merge the audit doc, the dep-array fix, and the test additions independently. |
| Refactor of `autofill_service.py` is needed even though we are skipping it | `cs/phase-1.4` is a dedicated audit of the new file to confirm whether the AI refresh concern from #589 still applies. If yes, we schedule a `cs/phase-1.6` to fix it. |

Rollback: each phase is one PR. To roll back the dep-array fix in
`cs/phase-1.1`, revert that PR. The test additions in 1.2 and 1.3
are net-new files and have no rollback concern beyond deleting the
file.

---

## 7. Summary

The 4 critical bugs in #589 are not as live as the issue body
suggests. Three are already fixed; the fourth is a one-line dep-array
addition. The bigger value of this phase is the test matrix from
#590, which gives the autofill pipeline a regression net it does not
currently have. The combined scope of `cs/phase-1` through
`cs/phase-1.4` is ~3.25 days, with `cs/phase-1.1` (the dep-array fix
plus its test) the only PR that touches production code.
